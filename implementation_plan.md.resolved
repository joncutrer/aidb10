# Implementation Plan - 10 Week AI Challenge Tracker

## Goal Description
Create a responsive, premium-designed web application to track a "10 Week AI Challenge". The app will persist data to a local disk store (JSON file) and allow the user to view weekly challenges, update progress with notes, and mark weeks as complete.

## User Review Required
- **Persistence Strategy**: We will use a local `weeks.json` file in the project directory for simplicity and portability. This meets the "disk store" requirement.
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) with Tailwind CSS.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
#### [NEW] [Project Scaffolding]
- Initialize `next-app` in `/home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10`.
- Configure Tailwind CSS.

### Backend & Data
#### [NEW] [lib/store.ts](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/lib/store.ts)
- Functions to read/write to `data/weeks.json`.
- `initStore()` function to seed the 10 weeks if the file doesn't exist.

#### [NEW] [app/api/weeks/route.ts](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/app/api/weeks/route.ts)
- `GET`: Retrieve all weeks.
- `POST`: Update a week (notes, completion status).

### Frontend
#### [NEW] [app/layout.tsx](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/app/layout.tsx)
- Global styles, Dark mode/Premium theme setup.

#### [NEW] [app/page.tsx](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/app/page.tsx)
- Main Dashboard.
- Summary card (Progress bar, "X/10 Weeks Completed").
- Grid of 10 Week Cards.
- Each Card shows: Title, Status (Pending/Done), truncated description. Click to expand/edit.

#### [NEW] [components/WeekCard.tsx](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/components/WeekCard.tsx)
- Reusable component for individual week display.
- Interactive hover effects.

#### [NEW] [components/WeekModal.tsx](file:///home/sysadmin/dev/aidb10/components/WeekModal.tsx)
- Modal or expanded view to edit notes and toggle completion.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None planned for this rapid prototype unless requested.

### Manual Verification
1. **Initial Load**: Verify the app creates `data/weeks.json` with 10 default weeks on first run.
2. **Persistence**:
    - Open Week 1.
    - Add a note: "Started researching LLMs".
    - Mark as "Complete".
    - Refresh the page.
    - Verify note and status persist.
3. **UI/UX**:
    - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes (via browser tool resizing).
    - Verify hover states and animations.
